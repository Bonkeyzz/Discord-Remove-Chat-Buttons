# Discord: Remove useless chat buttons
Remove the gift nitro, gif, sticker and app buttons from the chat bar in discord!
There's also Vencord/Betterdiscord compatible css files below.

## What is this for?
This repository is for those looking to hide the "Gift Nitro", "Boost this server", "Stickers", "GIF" or "App" buttons from the chat bar in discord. If reading this far into the future, please note that this may not work.<br>

There are 2 versions of the scripts here:<br>
1. "All" versions remove the Gift Nitro, Stickers GIF and App buttons, (Note that you can still access gifs and stickers via the tabs in the emoji button that remains)
2. "KeepGIF" versions remove the Gift Nitro, Sticker and App buttons only (Note that you can still access the stickers via the tab in the emoji/ gif buttons that remain)

## Vencord/Betterdiscord

Raw link here:
- Remove All - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bonkeyzz/Discord-Remove-useless-chat-buttons/main/RemoveChatButtonsAll.theme.css
- Keep GIF - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bonkeyzz/Discord-Remove-useless-chat-buttons/main/RemoveChatButtons.theme.css

For BetterDiscord, download the desired CSS file and put it in your `themes` folder.

# Notice
The .js files are userscripts you can use in the browser or can be pasted directly in the Developer console, though if you are experienced enough to use the develoeper console and want to go down that route, you will need to follow the guide in the original repo.
**IMPORTANT NOTICE: While this code is clean, I ADVISE TO NOT PASTE ANY CODE IN THE DEV CONSOLE. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS. I strongly advise to use the CSS files and a modded client like Vencord/BetterDiscord or OpenAsar which all allow custom theming.**
